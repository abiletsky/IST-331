# IST-331
Repo for IST 331 project

Technologies we are going to use:
~~- ASP.NET (C#) Backend~~
- Java Backend (Spring)
- JavaScript or TypeScript Frontend
	- TypeScript is a "superset" of JavaScript with strong typing (like Java, C#, C/C++) and gets converted into JS automatically.
	- Maybe use JQuery for easier DOM manipulation
- HTML5/CSS Frontend Styling
- MySQL or PostgreSQL for storage instead of JSON or XML

~~- We can use the EntityFramework library in C# to make connecting to and using the db easy~~
