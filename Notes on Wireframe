These are the comments Jody had on our wireframe:
- Move timer off the scope. Scope cannot be modified!
    - Probably to top bar
- Planes need to be represented as V shaped icons with only a 2 row data block that is always visible
    - Second row of data flickers back and forth
    - There should be a line to the data block from the V
